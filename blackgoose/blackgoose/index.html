<p>Came in here the other day after my entire day fell apart. I was waiting for my
car tire to be fixed, so I stopped in for a glass of wine and a delicious flatbread.
Kelsey, one of the bar managers, was super cool and the entire atmosphere of the
bistro was great! I will definitely be back.</p>
